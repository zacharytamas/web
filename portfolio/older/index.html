<h2>MyChipley</h2>

<p>MyChipley was a personal project I built and rebuilt for many years starting when I was fifteen years old but never actually got it off the ground: this was due mainly to a lack of business acumen in my teenage years and an adequate amount of shyness.</p>

<p>As envisioned, MyChipley would have been an online news source for the smalltown I grew up in, which had nothing similar that was of quality. The local newspaper was owned by an enormous news chain and was very impersonal and of poor quality. I wanted to build a new kind of &quot;socal&quot; (social-local) news company which leveraged the latest technology in web publishing to do new things the local printed paper either could not or would not think of doing.</p>

<p>I performed almost all work on MyChipley myself. Design, front-end and back-end development, server management. Regardless of whether the website ever took off, the process of building and rebuilding while working on every level of the product was a very enlightening one. I may have reinvented the wheel several times but I learned a lot about wheels.</p>

<p>I still believe the vision I had could work for the community in my hometown but unfortunately would require more time and funding than I have to get it really moving. I still keep the domain in my back pocket. =)</p>

<h2>UWF Life</h2>

<p>UWF Life was an iOS application I developed while a student at the <a href="http://www.uwf.edu/">University of West Florida</a>. It featured an campus map with walking directions to any building. If you didn&#39;t know what building you needed to go to, you could search by the department and find the building that way. Campus Emergency numbers were available with dialing shortcuts. A directory of dining facilities on-campus was included with their regular hours for reference, allowing the app to tell you your food options at any time of day. <em>Developed while learning Objective-C, iOS, and Cocoa on my own out of curiosity.</em></p>

<h2>NWFMarketplace</h2>

<p>NWFMarketplace was an extension of the MyChipley idea. It was an attempt at simplifying the vision to a smaller piece that could possibly have better chance of traction. Again, business inexperience led to this project not going very far but a lot was learned.</p>

<h2>Chipola College</h2>

<p>I was briefly employed by the community college I attended during high school. I proposed designs and <code>HTML/CSS</code> that ultimately influenced the first major redesign of the school&#39;s website in years.</p>

<h2>City of Marianna</h2>

<p>While still in high school, a friend/colleague and I were able to use our professional network to land a contract rebuilding a local city&#39;s government portal website. Was one of my first design <strong>and</strong> development projects and also one of my first professional uses of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django">Django</a>.</p>
