"Packages" recommended are typically patches that resolve bugs or increase performance, and the acceptance of these packages lead to more efficient healthcare for Cerner clients and their patients.</p><p>From the beginning there was a lot of hype about the project, as its planned functionality was an unprecedented amount of interactivity for a Lights-On dashboard. Even only having been on the team for two months, it was clear to me that the new JavaScript-centric direction many of our dashboards were headed that there needed to be an organized, focused driver of the effort. My <a href="/portfolio/screenly/">prior experience</a> with Backbone.js and proven skill with JavaScript led me to step forward and try my hand.</p><div class="float-right"> <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/300/technics"></div><p>Starting with the approved design mockups from our design team, I took to outlining the design and breaking the highly interactive pieces into components and structuring them in such a way that could be built largely in isolation yet highly communicative using Backbone.js methodologies. From this architecting stage, a series of implementation plans was derived, which was broken into standalone "tickets" that could be done (mostly) independently.</p><p>During the following iteration cycle, I took on the client-side implementation of the plan meanwhile others on the team each built their respective pieces including an HTTP API for retrieving a user's recommendations and saving changes or notes to them. Through open communication, the team was able to pull together tightly and complete the project smoothly: a true shining moment for all of us on the front-end team.</p><p>As part of my vision for JavaScript applications on the team in the future, I took the opportunity to include <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> into the project and began writing the first JavaScript tests the codebase had seen. Following test-driven development as disciplined as I'd ever managed, the project was completed with virtually no defects and over a hundred Jasmine tests covering almost all JavaScript components and their interactions. This habit of writing Jasmine tests for all new JavaScript functionality has stuck, with everyone on the team contributing to a test suite that increases every development cycle.</p><hr></div></div><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,s,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,s=a.createElement(t),o=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],s.async=1,s.src=n,o.parentNode.insertBefore(s,o)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-11164103-5","zacharytamas.me"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
