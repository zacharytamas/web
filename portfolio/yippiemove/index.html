Also became acquainted with essential email protocols.</li> <li>Contributed to designing and implementing YippieMove&#39;s <a href="http://www.yippiemove.com/help/api.html">first public API</a>, and an open source <a href="https://github.com/wireload/yippiemove-cli">command-line utility</a> for working with the API.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2>The Product</h2> <p>While working for a startup named <a href="http://wireload.net/">Wireload</a>, I contributed to the development of YippieMove, an email migration tool used by individuals, corporations, Ivy League universities, and even some Internet service providers.</p> <p>YippieMove facilitates the easy transfer of an entire email account from one provider to another. Common use cases include:</p> <ul> <li>Universities contract YippieMove to move students&#39; emails from their university accounts and to their personal account, allowing the university to delete the student email account after graduation.</li> <li>ISPs contract YippieMove to provide a simple way for their customers switching from other ISPs to transfer their emails into their new ISP email account.</li> <li>Individuals use YippieMove to consolidate their email accounts, or move emails from an old account before safely deleting it.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2>Skills Used/Developed on this Project</h2> <p>At YippieMove, we used Python with the Django framework. Client-side styling code was written in <a href="http://lesscss.org/" title="LESS">LESS</a> and compiled to CSS. JavaScript was used with frameworks such as jQuery to provide the interactivity featured in YippieMove&#39;s customer migration management panels.</p> <p>On the backend, YippieMove is powered by load-balanced <code>gunicorn</code> instances connected to PostgreSQL databases with some features using MongoDB. Email account authentication was provided by OAuth2. Migration tasks were managed asynchronously using Celery. Migration servers, &quot;movers&quot;, were spun up and down dynamically using CloudSigma as a cloud provider. Payments were processed initially by Google Checkout, but part of my work was to transition to Stripe.</p> <hr> </div> </div> <script>(function(d,e,j,h,f,c,b){d.GoogleAnalyticsObject=f;d[f]=d[f]||function(){(d[f].q=d[f].q||[]).push(arguments)},d[f].l=1*new Date();c=e.createElement(j),b=e.getElementsByTagName(j)[0];c.async=1;c.src=h;b.parentNode.insertBefore(c,b)})(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga");ga("create","UA-11164103-5","zacharytamas.me");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
