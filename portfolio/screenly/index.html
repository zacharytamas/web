  <h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Worked 100% remotely with team members across the globe, including California, London, Sweden, and Budapest.</li>
<li>Worked full stack from Python to browser-side coding to server administration (running Screenly on a Raspberry Pi).</li>
<li>Worked on both <a href="https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose">an open source version</a> of the Screenly software stack, and <a href="http://www.screenlyapp.com/">a professional version</a> for advertising agencies to manage a large amount of digital signs in their accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<p>While working for a startup named <a href="http://wireload.net/">Wireload</a>, I contributed to the development of two versions of <a href="http://screenlyapp.com/">Screenly</a>: an open source version and a professional, commercial version of the product with premium features.</p>

<p>Both versions of Screenly are centered around specialized software which runs on Raspberry Pi microcomputers to present web pages, image slideshows, and 1080p video to any display that can be driven via HDMI 2.0 or RCA composite cable.</p>

<p>The free, open source version of Screenly allows for a technically inclined user to easily setup their own Raspberry Pi, connect it to the Internet, and manage the content being shown on it by logging directly into it via a web interface.</p>

<p>Screenly Pro consists of a centralized, multi-tenant server cluster which periodically syncs with all the Screenly OSE screens across the world that it is configured to manage. Customers pay Screenly to allow them to manage all of their Screenly-powered screens from one interface instead of logging into individual screens to update content. Screenly Pro allows you to add content and spread it across all of your screens in almost realtime, converting videos and optimizing imagery before automatically pushing the latest content directly where it needs to go.</p>

<h2>Skills Used/Developed on this Project</h2>

<p>On this project we used Python with the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html" title="Bottle">Bottle</a> framework backed by <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a>. Our client-side styles were written in <a href="http://lesscss.org/" title="LESS">LESS</a> and compiled to CSS.</p>

<p>While on this project I learned <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" title="CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="Backbone.js">Backbone.js</a>. As one of my first major JavaScript-heavy projects, I rapidly self-educated myself with all JavaScript resources that I could find. It was part of my Annual Goals for 2013 to &quot;build exceptional interactive experiences with JavaScript&quot; and this project lent itself very well to that aspiration.</p>

<p>I also gained experience with lower-level hardware concerns as we built Raspian images of Linux pre-loaded with our Python code to run on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>. While most of my time was spent with the front-end scripting, I had my hands in some of the Python and video playing components of the project, deploying code directly to a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2>Case Study: <span>Dealing With Limited Resources</span></h2>

<p>Engineering software for Screenly was an interesting new challenge because you became very well aware of the limitations of the hardware. Generally those of us engineers who work on the web aren&#39;t overly concerned with the performance of every line of code as servers running the code or users&#39; machines running your JavaScript are reasonably well-resourced in general.</p>

<div class="pullout image">
    <img src="/public/portfolio/screenly/pi.jpg" width="100%">
</div>

<p>This was not the case at all for Screenly. Because the core unit of the Screenly system is a server that runs on a Raspberry Pi, efficient algorithms and processes were absolutely paramount in its development. An operation which on a typical desktop computer might take seconds may perhaps take a minute or more on the limited ARM processor in a $35 Raspberry Pi. Special care was taken in writing efficient syncing algorithms to manage the Pis remotely without bogging them down, especially when they could at any moment be rendering and displaying 1080p HD video.</p>

<p>Another less obvious resource concern was the storage of a Pi: there isn&#39;t any. Raspberry Pis&#39; primary source of storage are SD cards such as you might use in a digital camera. Due to the regular syncing of Screenly and downloading/updating/deleting of media, care was taken to be good stewards of storage to protect the health of the SD cards as much as possible so that their lifespans were maximized.</p>
