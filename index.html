    <p>While this is a completely different way of thinking about building front-end applications, it's pretty interesting. It's definitely going to take some time for me to get used to it but I think this is a pretty cool thing to explore.

      <span class="date">28 Feb 2014</span>
    </div>
    <p>I love this imagining of a more readable Wikipedia design. It's definitely true that Wikipedia as it stands is horribly designed, with poor typography and overly cluttered sidebars. I'd really enjoy seeing something like this become a reality.

      <span class="date">23 Feb 2014</span>
    </div>
    <p>This will be taken down soon probably due to copyright, but this is a really handy tool. I use Google Play Music and it is very frustrating that the app is a second-class citizen on my computer. You can alleviate some of the issues with Chrome plugins that proxy the media keys through to the tab Google Music is open in, but even aside that I've found that the webapp is buggy in Chrome (at least). This desktop app (which is just a Webkit wrapper) has been performing perfectly for me, surprisingly.

      <span class="date">18 Feb 2014</span>
    </div>
    <p>This is a cool collection of resources for learning how to write JavaScript "the right way". I'm always a fan of doing things the right way, even if it takes a little longer or more effort, so this was well appreciated. A lot of things here I already know and do instinctively, but the lists of design patterns and testing tools were a great reference.

      <span class="date">12 Feb 2014</span>
    </div>
    <p>This is an interesting concept for creating permalinks to places inside content that can change. When content such as online news articles changes, the relative position of sentences can change, causing naive links that point to, for example, the n-th paragraph of an article to become wrong. Emphasis is a cool idea for creating smarter permalinks that always point to the same content, even when an article has been drastically revised.

    <p>I'm looking forward to playing with this to generate all kinds of directed graphs for visualizations, even if I just use it to make fancy wallpapers for my tablet or something. Can't think of an immediate use for this but I'll keep it in the back of my mind.

    <p>This is pretty cool. My roommate has a TV that accepts casts from certain applications such as YouTube and we've had some fun with playing with the JavaScript SDK to push random videos to the TV at any time. I might have Rick Rolled him in the middle of watching TV before...

    </div>
    <p>New version of CoffeeScript is released today. Pretty cool enhancements but none I'm super excited about it, though. The new operators are pretty cool, however. I haven't been using Coffee lately as much as I used to, even sometimes electing to use JS when I could have used Coffee. Not sure why that is.
