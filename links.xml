   <content type="html">I&#39;m looking forward to playing with this to generate all kinds of directed graphs for visualizations, even if I just use it to make fancy wallpapers for my tablet or something. Can&#39;t think of an immediate use for this but I&#39;ll keep it in the back of my mind.

   <content type="html">This is pretty cool. My roommate has a TV that accepts casts from certain applications such as YouTube and we&#39;ve had some fun with playing with the JavaScript SDK to push random videos to the TV at any time. I might have Rick Rolled him in the middle of watching TV before...

   <title>CoffeeScript 1.7 released</title>
   <link href="http://coffeescript.org/#changelog"/>
   <updated>2014-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://coffeescript.org/#changelog</id>
   <content type="html">New version of CoffeeScript is released today. Pretty cool enhancements but none I&#39;m super excited about it, though. The new operators are pretty cool, however. I haven&#39;t been using Coffee lately as much as I used to, even sometimes electing to use JS when I could have used Coffee. Not sure why that is.

   <title>Internet Explorer (8) Array.sort Unreliable</title>
   <link href="http://www.zachleat.com/web/array-sort/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.zachleat.com/web/array-sort/</id>
   <content type="html">Fought this dumb bug at work today. In sorting functions given to Array.prototype.sort() in JavaScript, if you reassign argument variables&#39; values in the function, IE8 may completely break on you, sometimes resulting in one or both of your comparison values becoming undefined randomly. Though it makes no sense JavaScript-wise, to fix this bug, you have to declare your own, separate variables for your values.

   <title>Coding in color</title>
   <link href="https://medium.com/p/3a6db2743a1e/"/>

   <id>https://medium.com/p/3a6db2743a1e/</id>
   <content type="html">This is a cool idea. I&#39;ve never actually thought about syntax highlighting, but now that I do, it does seem kind of not terribly helpful. I definitely notice it if it&#39;s not there, but I&#39;m not sure I could tell you the specific color of a piece of code (variable declarations are blue, etc.). It&#39;s entirely subconscious.

   <content type="html">Way too much honesty here. The Zone we creative types work in is such a fickle thing, leading to irrational responses to anything that threatens it while we&#39;re in it. A nice write-up for friends and significant-others of creative types, explaining why if you interrupt The Zone and we&#39;re mean to you, we&#39;re sorry, but it&#39;s no one&#39;s fault.

   <content type="html">A &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; nice write-up about how to tackle common front-end application performance bottlenecks. I&#39;ve employed a few of these tricks myself in the past to achieve better performance in slower browsers (I&#39;m looking at you, IE).

   <content type="html">This is a really cool pathfinding library using the A* Search Algorithm. It&#39;s designed for adding to your games and other JavaScript apps where pathfinding plays a role. Check out their website for a snazzy demonstration of the library guiding a group of soldiers across a randomly generated terrain.

   <title>4K is for programmers</title>

   <id>http://tiamat.tsotech.com/4k-is-for-programmers</id>
   <content type="html">Interesting read about using a low-price 4K television as a computer display for development. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about using this high of resolution as a computer display, though. It&#39;s entirely too many pixels for me, I feel like.
